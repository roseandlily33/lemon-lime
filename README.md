## Design:
For the design I knew that I wanted to go with citrus colours, I created a custom logo and background. 
I tried to follow as many good UI practices as I could within my time constraints like adding clear labels, tooltips, descriptions, hierarchy of data, different colour buttons for primary and secondary buttons. 

## Choices:
For the backend I chose MongoDB, because of it easy with flexibility when it comes to storing data, it gave me the ease of not having to have every part of the recipe that I wanted to include right away and was able to build out the application with ease. It also came with features that I knew that I wanted to implement such as regex for searching a recipe, created at to filter the newest recipes posted and the most popular recipes.
